(Music) Amanda Palmer (singing):
Ground Control to Major Tom, Ground Control to Major Tom, Take your protein pills
and put your helmet on. Al Gore: Ten, Nine, Eight, Seven, Six ... AP: Ground Control to Major Tom, AG: Five, Four, Three, Two, One ...
AP: Commencing countdown, engines on. Check ignition and may God's love be with you. AG: Liftoff. AP: This is Ground Control to Major Tom, You've really made the grade And the papers want to know whose shirts you wear. Now it's time to leave the capsule if you dare. "This is Major Tom to Ground Control, I'm stepping through the door And I'm floating in a most peculiar way And the stars look very different today. For here am I floating round my tin can. Far above the world, Planet Earth is blue and there's nothing I can do." (Music) "Though I'm past 100,000 miles, I'm feeling very still, and I think my spaceship knows
which way to go. Tell my wife I love her very much she knows." Ground Control to Major Tom, your circuit's dead, there's something wrong. Can you hear me, Major Tom? Can you hear me, Major Tom? Can you hear me, Major Tom? Can you ... "Here am I floating round my tin can, far above the Moon. Planet Earth is blue and there's nothing I can do. (Music) ["I'm not a prophet or a stone-age man, just a mortal with the potential
of a superman ... ... I'm living on." 
David Bowie, 1947-2016] (Applause)
